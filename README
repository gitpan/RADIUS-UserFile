RADIUS::UserFile -- a module to manipulate information in a RADIUS users file.

This is the first release of the module, so test well before using it in a
production environment.  I'm using it in one, and haven't had any problems
so far.

Installation is the typical routine:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

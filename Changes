    - applied bug fixes from Burkhard Weeber:
      Fixed documentation of the comment facility.  It was saying to
      use "Comments" for the field name, when "Comment" is actually
      correct.  Also, the Password attribute is now always put first
      in the user entry if it exists.  Finally, the columnar alignment
      of attributes was changed so that longer usernames would still
      look nice and wouldn't screw up the file.
